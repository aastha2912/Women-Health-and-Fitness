									<h2>FITNESS FIRST</h2>
									
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p> What does it mean to be fit? Fitness doesn’t have to mean that you’re an ultra-marathoner or that you can perform one pull-up or one hundred. Fitness can mean different things for different people. “For me, fitness is first and foremost about feeling good and being able to move without pain,” says the certified strength and conditioning specialist Grayson Wickham, a New YorkCity–based physical therapist and the founder of Movement Vault, a mobility and movement company. </p>
								<p>He explains that true fitness is about feeling healthy and being in sufficient shape to do the activities you want to do and live the lifestyle you want to live. Can you play with your kids orgrandkids? If hiking the Inca Trail is on your bucket list, can you do it? Do you feel good after a day spent gardening? Are you able to climb all the necessary the stairs in your life without getting winded or having to take a break?</p>

									<hr />
									<p> “Your body is precious. It is our vehicle for awakening. Treat it with care.” ~Buddha</p>
									<p> Stop obsessing over external appearances and obtaining an ideal body, and instead focus on the way being healthy makes you feel and what it gives you. You’ll find a deeper sense of gratification and more motivation to stay on track. You’ll also begin to lose tolerance for the way unhealthy choices make you feel. Treat yourself with the utmost respect, and you will want to give your body the healthy choices that it deserves and needs to function in the best way possible. Keep Growing and Loving Yourself!</p>

									</header>
									<hr />
									<p > "Healthy living" to most people means both physical and mental health are in balance. They both are closely linked, so that a change (good or bad) in one directly affects the other. Good nutrition, daily exercise and adequate sleep are the foundations of healthy living. A healthy lifestyle keeps you fit, energetic and at reduced risk for disease. When you adopt a healthy lifestyle, you provide a more positive role model for other people in your family, particularly children. You will also create a better environment for them to grow up in. By helping them to follow a healthier lifestyle, you will be contributing to their wellbeing and enjoyment of life now and in the future.</p>
